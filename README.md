# conversationLogger
Objective: Save clipboard content in a file for future reference

**Overview:**
On daily basis I use github co-pilot and I was exploring if I can save conversation history in a file that I can refer to later on. This program helps me to save content in a file that I copied in a clipboard.

Stop the program once you decide not to save clipboard content.

**Revision information:**
First version of program was created on Jun 11, 2025
